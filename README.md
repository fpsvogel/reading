Reading is a Ruby gem that parses a CSV reading log. [My personal site's Reading page](https://fpsvogel.com/reading/) is built with the help of this gem.

## Why am I building this?

Because I love reading and keeping track of my reading, but I don't like the limitations of Goodreads and similar sites. In particular:

- I don't like going into a site or app every time I want to make a small change such as adding a note. I find it much faster to edit a plain text file which I always have open on my computer, or which I can quickly pull up on my phone via a Dropbox-syncing text editor (I use the Android app [Simple Text](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=simple.text.dropbox)).
- I don't like being limited to a database of existing book metadata. In Goodreads you can add new titles to their database, but that is cumbersome. Plus, it's nice to be able to track items other than books.
- On Goodreads, my reading data is theirs, not mine.

So I started tracking my reading and notes directly in a CSV file. Then a problem arose: how to share my reading log with friends? I'm sure they wouldn't want to wade through my massive CSV file.

That's where Reading helps: it transforms my `reading.csv` into data that I can selectively display on a page on my site.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "reading"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reading

## Usage

The most basic usage is simply to specify the path to your CSV reading log, and it will be parsed with the default configuration. See [CSV documentation](#csv-documentation) below to learn about the expected format of the CSV file.

```ruby
file_path = "/home/user/reading.csv"
csv = Reading::CSV.new(path: file_path)
items_hashes = csv.parse
```

This returns an array of hashes, each representing an item (such as a book or podcast) structured like the template hash in `default_config[:item][:template]` in [config.rb](https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading/blob/main/lib/reading/config.rb).

If instead of a file path you want to directly parse a string or file (anything responding to `#each_line`):

```ruby
csv_string_or_file = File.read(file_path)
csv = Reading::CSV.new(csv_string_or_file)
items_hashes = csv.parse
```

To use custom configuration, pass a config hash when initializing:

```ruby
custom_config = { csv: { skip_compact_planned: true } }
csv = Reading::CSV.new(path: file_path, config: custom_config)
items_hashes = csv.parse
```

## CSV documentation

The [CSV format guide](https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading/blob/main/doc/csv-format-guide.rb) shows by example how to set up a CSV reading log of your own. The parsing features are documented more comprehensively in [`test/csv_parse_test.rb`](https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading/blob/main/test/csv_parse_test.rb).

## How to add a reading page to your site

After Reading parses your CSV reading log, it's up to you to display that parsed information on a webpage. I've set up my personal site so that it automatically parses my reading log during site generation, and it's even automatically generated every week to update my reading page. I explain how I did this in my tutorial ["Build a blog with Bridgetown"](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown), which may give you ideas even if you don't use [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) to build your siteâ€¦ but you should use Bridgetown, it's great ðŸ˜‰
