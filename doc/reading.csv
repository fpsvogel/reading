\ For Plain Reading to parse planned these compact planned items, you must:
    \ - Include the format emoji before each title.
    \ - Start the line with a comment character, then a single genre in all caps, then a colon (:).
\ The all-caps genre is changed to lowercase in Plain Reading. So if you have a "science" genre, the items after "SCIENCE" here will be in that same "science" genre.
\ At the end of an item you can list sources, each immediately preceded by "@".

\ By default, planned items are visible only to friends.
\ To change this and other settings, and to discover even more features not covered here, see the Settings page: https://plainreading.com/settings
