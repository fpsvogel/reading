\ This is a template for your own plain-text reading log.
\ This file can be parsed by the Reading gem, so that you can show some of your reading on a webpage.
\ Example: fpsvogel.com/reading
\ For guidance on each of the columns below, see the CSV format guide:
\ https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading/blob/main/doc/csv-format.md
\
\ Any line in this file starting with a backslash (\) is a comment and will be ignored by the Reading parser.
\ Feel free to delete these explanatory comments.
\
\ You can edit this file in any spreadsheet app or text editor.
\ When you open the file, be sure to select the pipe character (|) as the column separator.
\
\ I highly recommend the Rainbow CSV extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv
\ Be sure to set VS Code's Language Mode to "CSV (pipe)".
\
\ Also, entering a row is much less cumbersome if you set up keyboard shortcuts for a row template and for today's date.
\ You can use one of these two scripts:
\   https://github.com/fpsvogel/reading/blob/main/doc/ruby_reading_csv_row_shortcut.rb
