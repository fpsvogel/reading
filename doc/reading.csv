|🔊Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind|Vail Library B00ICN066A|2021/09/20||history, wisdom|15:17|💬History with a sociological bent, with special attention paid to human happiness. -- Ch. 5: "We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us." -- End of ch. 8: the ubiquity of patriarchal societies is so far unexplained. It would make more sense for women (being on average more socially adept) to have formed a matriarchal society as among the bonobos. -- Ch. 19: are we happier in modernity? It's doubtful.
